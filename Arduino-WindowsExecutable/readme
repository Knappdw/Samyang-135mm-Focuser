## Samyang 135mm Focuser-Arduino.zip
This zip file contains the Arduino.ino file that is used in conjunction with the WFA program above.  For this project, I have been using the Arduino Nano 33 IoT and the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense chips.

Both the windows code and the arduino code are under development and poorly commented.  The current version of this project is being provided as requested by multiple readers.  This project will be updated in time with sufficient details.
