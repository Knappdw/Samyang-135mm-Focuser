# Samyang 135mm Focuser

## Initial Repository Notes
This is the first repository that I have created in github so please extend all newbie courtesies to this project.

## General Project Description
This project is for a computer controlled focuser for the Samyang 135mm Lens.  This project is currently under development and makes use of 3d-printed materials and code pertaining to a Samyang 135mm lens collar and focuser for Astrophotography.

This repository will only contain the code elements for the focuser but I will provide a complete project overview here once finished.

The Samyang 135mm Lens Collar is hosted on Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5615266
