# Samyang 135mm Focuser

## Initial Repository Notes
This is the first repository that I have created in github so please extend all newbie courtesies to this project.

## General Project Description
This project is for a computer controlled focuser for the Samyang 135mm Lens.  This project is currently under development and makes use of 3d-printed materials and code pertaining to a Samyang 135mm lens collar and focuser for Astrophotography.

This repository will only contain the code elements for the focuser but I will provide a complete project overview here once finished.

The Samyang 135mm Lens Collar is hosted on Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5615266

More details about this and other projects can be found on my blog: https://sleeplesslights.com

## Arduino-WindowsExecutable Directory
There are 2 zip files included in the Arduino-WindowsExecutable directory which contain the Arduino .ino file for a Nano 33 IoT or Nano 33 BLE Sense chip and the Windows Forms App executable for running the program stand alone.  Please note that these files test and perform as desired, however this really is just at a proof of concept stage at this point.
